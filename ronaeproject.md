 Machine learning can be used to predict traffic patterns and suggest optimal routes, which could reduce these negative impacts. This project aims to analyze traffic flow data to predict congestion levels at specific times and locations 

The dataset for this project is the METR-LA Traffic Dataset, which contaisn traffic readings from loop detectors on Los Angeles County freeways. It includes data on speed, volume, and occupancy for various locations over several months. The dataset is available Github repository of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). 

## Introduction
Traffic congestion in urban areas leads to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and air pollution. This project uses machine learning to predict traffic patterns and suggest optimal routes using the METR-LA dataset.

## Dataset
The METR-LA dataset contains traffic readings (speed, volume, and occupancy) from loop detectors on Los Angeles County freeways. Access it (https://github.com/Caltrans/METR-LA).

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and explored the dataset to identify patterns.
- **Model**: Trained a neural network to predict traffic speed based on historical data.
- **Evaluation**: Measured the modelâ€™s performance using RMSE and accuracy metrics.

## Results
Below is a visualization of the traffic speed data over time:

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning for traffic prediction, with potential applications in route optimization and congestion management.
