 Machine learning can be used to predict traffic patterns and suggest optimal routes, which could reduce these negative impacts. This project aims to analyze traffic flow data to predict congestion levels at specific times and locations 

The dataset for this project is the METR-LA Traffic Dataset, which contains traffic readings from loop detectors on Los Angeles County freeways. It includes data on speed, volume, and occupancy for various locations over several months. The dataset is available Github repository of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). 

## Introduction
Traffic congestion in urban areas leads to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and air pollution. This project uses machine learning to predict traffic patterns and suggest optimal routes using the METR-LA dataset. Los Angeles is known for its sprawling freeway network whichb often causes congestion, especially during rush hour. This datatset us a prime candidate for machine learning due to it displaying time-series data with continuous features that allows us to apply various techniques for analysis, prediction, and optimization. Traffic data exhibits complex patterns such as temporal dependencies and spatial dependencies. This makes the dataset suitable for applying supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or reinforcement learning approaches. 


## Dataset
The METR-LA dataset contains traffic readings (speed, volume, and occupancy) from loop detectors on Los Angeles County freeways. Access it (https://github.com/Caltrans/METR-LA). ![Figure_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66486adb-3064-4403-aa0e-7a6dc636bf9b)


## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and explored the dataset to identify patterns.
- **Model**: Trained a neural network to predict traffic speed based on historical data.
- **Evaluation**: Measured the modelâ€™s performance using RMSE and accuracy metrics.

## Results
Below is a visualization of the traffic speed data over time:

## Conclusion
To address the problem of trafffic congestion in LA, the METR-LA dataset enables a variety of machine learning approaches which include, supervised learning (can be used for predicting future traffic conditions), unsupervised learning (identifying patterns and anomalies which can be used to detect unusal traffic behavior), and reinforcement learning (optimizes real-time management of traffic such as adjusting traffic signals timings or rerouting vehicles to improve flow of traffic.
